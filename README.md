# deeplearningchallenge

Overview of the analysis - Explain the purpose of this analysis:
For the deep learning module the pupose is to create a toool to be able to select successful applicants for funding using machine learning.

Data Preprocessing:
What variable(s) are the target(s) for your model?
- IS_SUCCESSFUL Column.
  
What variable(s) are the features for your model?
- AFFILIATION, APPLICATION_TYPE, ASK_AMT, CLASSIFICATION, INCOME_AMT, ORGANIZATION, STATUS, SPECIAL_CONSIDERATIONS.

What variable(s) should be removed from the input data because they are neither targets nor features?
- NAME and EIN are not needing in this model.

Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model
How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural network model, and why?
- Neuron: Between 1-120
- Layers: Between 1-5
- Activation Functions: 3 and 1 for output.
  
Were you able to achieve the target model performance?
- Accuracy was at 73%

What steps did you take in your attempts to increase model performance?
- With the section of Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the model section based on the layers and neurons used I tried what I could with that information for improvement on my mobel. With the activation functions as well, based on what I was able to accomplish it wasn't bad but could only get at 73%. With more practice and knowledge in the future I can attempt again and see if I can make it better.
  
Summary: Summarize the overall results of the deep learning model. Include a recommendation for how a different model could solve this classification problem, and then explain your recommendation.
- Based on what I was able to complete in my model I could try different layers and moving around between them also with the neurons and activation functions. Mostly on what I was mentioning on the previous question I believe tweaking and moving around my model I could try different things to make it a higher accuracy. With time and more knowledge of what I can try I believe I can attempt to make the model stronger. So far on what I was able to do looks great and hoping to improve in the future.
